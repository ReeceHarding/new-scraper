# MASTER DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOL

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
1. Open @Step1-Detailed-Checklist.md
2. Find first `[]` task
3. Start implementing NOW - no discussion

## BEFORE YOU START
MUST have:
1. Full schema understanding from migrations
2. Table relationships mapped
3. Environment variables documented
4. Existing codebase functionality mapped

## DEVELOPMENT CYCLE
For each task:

### 1. IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION
- Write tests FIRST
- Show test file
- Show test passing
- Implement solution
- Show working code

### 2. VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS
Must show proof of:
- Schema alignment
- Complete call trace
- Integration tests
- Passing test suite
- Logging output
- Performance metrics

### 3. COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS
Before marking [x]:
- Show git commits proving TDD
- Paste test suite output
- Show call trace verification
- Demonstrate schema matching
- Present logging evidence
- ALL tests must pass

## DATABASE RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS
- NO RLS ever
- NO required columns in existing tables
- ALL migrations must be safe
- ALL foreign keys validated
- Show migration test results

## CODE STANDARDS - MUST FOLLOW
- SOLID principles
- Modular components
- Complete test coverage
- Clear logging
- Proper documentation

## CRITICAL RULES
1. NO marking [x] without ALL proofs
2. NO skipping validation
3. NO assumptions
4. NO incomplete testing
5. NO shortcuts

## FORBIDDEN ACTIVITIES
- Writing analysis docs
- Explaining plans
- Asking questions
- Making claims without proof
- Skipping any tests

## GET TO WORK
- Code first, talk later
- Show all proof
- Keep working until done
- ALL `[]` must become `[x]`
- Each [x] requires full evidence

Remember: PROVE EVERYTHING. CODE NOW. NO SHORTCUTS.
