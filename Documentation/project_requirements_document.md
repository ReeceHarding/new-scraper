# AI-Powered Lead Generation and Outreach Platform – Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

This project is about building an intelligent, automated platform designed to help businesses, especially small to medium-sized ones and startups, to generate high-quality leads and perform personalized outreach. The platform takes in natural language business goals and, using artificial intelligence, transforms those goals into targeted search strategies. It then automatically discovers potential client websites, extracts valuable contact information, analyzes business details, and finally builds personalized outreach templates for consistent client engagement. The essence of the project is to reduce manual labour, streamline the lead generation process, and directly tie outreach success to tangible, pay-per-lead results.

The platform is being built as a web application to handle multiple data-intensive operations and integrations with external services like Brave Search, OpenAI, SendGrid/Mailgun, and Twilio. The key objectives include easy onboarding through a clean single-page interface, smart conversion of natural language goals into actionable insights, automation of website analysis and email extraction, and ultimately enabling automated, personalized outreach supported by analytics and reporting to measure campaign performance. Success will be measured by the ease of use, effectiveness in converting user goals into leads, and the platform’s ability to demonstrate tangible outreach results.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   A single-page interface for business goal entry.
*   Natural language processing to understand and convert business goals into targeted search strategies.
*   Integration with the Brave Search API for intelligent, location-aware, and industry-specific query generation.
*   Website analysis module that crawls sites (up to 2 levels), stores XML content, extracts emails and business details, and validates extracted contact information.
*   Structured lead organization using Supabase to store structured data including emails, website summaries, and business metadata.
*   AI-powered outreach module that generates personalized email templates based on contextual website analysis.
*   Two primary user roles: Admins (with full feature access) and Regular Users (with core functionality).
*   User authentication via Supabase (token-based authentication with email/password and third-party sign-in options).
*   Analytics and reporting features for tracking outreach performance such as email open rates, click-through rates, and conversion statistics.
*   Integration with third-party services like SendGrid/Mailgun for email delivery and Twilio for additional contact verification processes.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Extensive user management features for Regular Users beyond typical account creation and profile access.
*   Advanced customization of UI/UX beyond a clean, modern minimalist design with a cool color palette.
*   Mobile-specific application development for now, though a basic mobile version may be considered in future phases.
*   Integration with additional customer support systems (e.g., in-app help center, tutorials) as a separate app will handle automated email responses later.
*   Any privacy or security feature enhancements (e.g., row-level security is disabled as per requirements).

## 3. User Flow

A typical user journey starts with the user signing up and logging in using the secure, token-based authentication powered by Supabase. Once logged in, the user is directed to a simple single-page interface where they can enter their business goals in everyday language. After entering these goals (for example, “I make websites for dentists”), the system uses natural language processing to interpret the intent and converts it into targeted search strategies. The user then sees a dashboard where results from the Brave Search API and AI-generated queries appear, clearly organized to show potential leads.

After the search process, the platform automatically analyzes discovered websites by crawling up to two levels deep. The extracted data—which includes emails, contact information, and business metadata—is stored and organized in Supabase. The user then reviews these organized leads on the dashboard, where details are clearly presented including website summaries and validated contact details. In the final step, the outreach automation module kicks in, providing AI-generated, context-aware email templates. The user can send these personalized outreach messages, and afterward, view the real-time analytics dashboard to track metrics like open rates and conversion statistics, helping them gauge campaign performance and refine their approach.

    *   Additional plugin integrations and IDE extensions as required to streamline development.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**

    *   The platform should maintain fast response times, ideally under 2 seconds for API responses and UI interactions.
    *   Efficient crawling and data processing to handle multiple simultaneous searches without significant lag.

*   **Usability:**

    *   The user interface must be intuitive and accessible with a clean, modern design.
    *   Clear visual dashboards and feedback mechanisms should be in place to enhance user experience.

*   **Security:**

    *   Although data privacy requirements are minimal (with RLS disabled for this project), standard token-based authentication must be robust.
    *   API integrations should secure proper handling of tokens and ensure that email delivery services are used responsibly.

*   **Scalability and Reliability:**

    *   The system should be built to scale as the number of users and leads grows.
    *   Use of cloud-based services (Supabase, external APIs) should contribute to maintaining high availability and uptime.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Constraints:**

    *   Row-level security (RLS) is disabled as per user instructions, so data handling will not include granular user-specific access control.
    *   Integration with external APIs such as Brave Search, OpenAI, SendGrid/Mailgun, and Twilio implies dependency on their uptime and rate limits.
    *   The platform will be developed primarily as a web application; mobile-specific functionalities are out-of-scope for the first version.

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   The target users are primarily SMBs and startups with limited marketing resources, hence the focus on automation and pay-per-lead monetization.
    *   The design will follow a minimalist, modern aesthetic, using a blue and grey color scheme without stringent branding guidelines.
    *   The development team will rely on readily available tools like Supabase for backend infrastructure and Cursor as the main IDE.
    *   User authentication will use Supabase’s token-based system, and third-party integrations (Google, Facebook) are assumed for social sign-ins.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **External API Limitations:**

    *   Rate limits or downtime from Brave Search API, OpenAI API, SendGrid/Mailgun, or Twilio may affect the platform’s real-time functionalities.
    *   Mitigation: Implement proper error handling, caching of recent queries/responses, and fallback scenarios if an API fails.

*   **Data Quality and Validation:**

    *   The website crawling and email extraction processes might encounter inconsistent website structures and data formats.
    *   Mitigation: Use robust parsing algorithms and add validation tools to ensure data consistency.

*   **Scalability Concerns:**

    *   As the volume of leads and searches increases, the system must handle the scaling of both the backend and the database.
    *   Mitigation: Employ scalable cloud services and monitor performance continuously to adjust resources as needed.

*   **Automated Outreach Accuracy:**

    *   AI-generated email templates need to strike a balance between personalization and professionalism.
    *   Mitigation: Provide options for user modifications and testing different templates in controlled environments before full rollout.

*   **Disabled Security Measures:**

    *   With RLS disabled, there could be potential risks related to data mishandling.
    *   Mitigation: Although data privacy is not a primary concern, ensure that other basic security practices are followed, such as secure token management and safe third-party integrations.
