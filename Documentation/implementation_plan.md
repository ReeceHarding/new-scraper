# Implementation Plan: AI-Powered Lead Generation and Outreach Platform

This document details a step-by-step plan to build the platform as defined by the project requirements. Each step references the original documents (PRD, Q&A, App Flow, Tech Stack) to ensure clarity and proper guidance for the development process.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  Check for Node.js installation and verify with `node -v`. If not installed, install Node.js (latest LTS recommended) and ensure npm is available. **(PRD: Section 5, Tech Stack: Backend)**

2.  Install and configure Supabase CLI and create a new Supabase project with RLS disabled. **(PRD: Section 2, Tech Stack: Database)**

3.  Initialize a Git repository at the project root. Create two branches: `main` for production and `dev` for development. **(PRD: Section 7, Developer Best Practices)**

4.  Create the base project directory structure:

    *   `/frontend` for the React web app
    *   `/backend` for the Node.js Express server
    *   `/infra` for deployment scripts/configs **(File Structure Document: Directory layout)**

5.  **Validation**: Run `node -v`, `npm -v`, and list directories to confirm all installations and structure are correct.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  Initialize a React project inside `/frontend` (e.g., using Create React App or a custom Webpack setup) adhering to a modern minimalist design with blue/grey palette. **(Tech Stack: Frontend, PRD: Section 3 – User Flow)

2.  Create authentication components:

    *   Create `/frontend/src/components/SignupLogin.jsx` to handle user sign-up and login via Supabase token-based auth. **(PRD: Section 1.3, Q&A: User Authentication)

3.  Develop the single-page Business Goals input interface:

    *   Create `/frontend/src/components/BusinessGoalForm.jsx` with a simple form for entering business goals.
    *   Integrate NLP query conversion (calls to backend; later invoking OpenAI API). **(PRD: Section 1 – Goal-Based Lead Discovery, App Flow: Business goal input)

4.  Develop the Dashboard to display search results and leads:

    *   Create `/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` to show target search strategies, leads from website analysis, and analytics metrics. **(PRD: Section 3 – Website Analysis & Lead Organization, Q&A: Analytics)

5.  Implement API service calls using axios:

    *   Create `/frontend/src/services/api.js` containing functions to call backend endpoints such as `/api/goals`, `/api/search`, `/api/analyze`, and `/api/outreach`. **(App Flow: Step integration, PRD: Entire Workflow)

6.  **Validation**: Write and run unit tests for components (e.g., using Jest) found in `/frontend/src/__tests__/` ensuring 100% test coverage for critical UI components.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  Initialize a Node.js Express project in `/backend` by running `npm init` and installing Express and required packages. **(Tech Stack: Backend, PRD: Section 5)

2.  Set up user authentication endpoints:

    *   Create `/backend/routes/auth.js` with endpoints for signup and login that integrate with Supabase authentication. **(PRD: Section 3, Q&A: Authentication)

3.  Build the Goal Processing API:

    *   Create `/backend/routes/goals.js` containing a `POST /api/goals` endpoint to receive business goals and call OpenAI API for generating targeted search queries. **(PRD: Section 1, Core Feature: Goal-Based Lead Discovery)

4.  Create the Intelligent Search API endpoint:

    *   Create `/backend/routes/search.js` with a `GET /api/search` endpoint that integrates with the Brave Search API to return refined, location-aware search results. **(PRD: Section 2, Q&A: Intelligent Search)

5.  Develop Website Analysis endpoints:

    *   Create `/backend/routes/analyze.js` with a `POST /api/analyze` endpoint to trigger depth-first crawling (up to 2 levels) and XML content extraction for contact information. **(PRD: Section 3, Core Feature: Website Analysis)

6.  Build the Lead Organization endpoints:

    *   Create `/backend/routes/leads.js` with endpoints to store, categorize, and retrieve lead data in Supabase (ensure use of PostgreSQL via Supabase). **(PRD: Section 4, App Flow: Lead Organization)

7.  Develop the Outreach Automation API:

    *   Create `/backend/routes/outreach.js` with a `POST /api/outreach` endpoint. This endpoint calls OpenAI to generate context-aware email templates and integrates with SendGrid/Mailgun to send emails. **(PRD: Section 4, Q&A: Outreach Automation)

8.  **Validation**: Write and run API tests (using Postman or curl) for each endpoint. For example, test `POST /api/goals` with sample business goal and verify the response contains a valid search strategy. Place tests in `/backend/tests/`.

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  Connect the frontend BusinessGoalForm with the backend by adding an axios call in `/frontend/src/services/api.js` to `POST /api/goals`. **(App Flow: Integration Step 1, PRD: Goal-Based Lead Discovery)
2.  Connect the Dashboard component with backend endpoints (`/api/search`, `/api/analyze`, `/api/leads`, `/api/outreach`) to retrieve and display data in real time. **(PRD: User Flow & Analytics)
3.  Configure Supabase authentication on the frontend to use the token-based system provided by Supabase. **(PRD: Section 3, Q&A: Authentication)
4.  Set up proper CORS configurations in the backend (e.g., using cors middleware) to allow requests from `http://localhost:3000`. **(Tech Stack: Backend, PRD: Section 2)
5.  **Validation**: Test the full user journey by signing up, logging in, entering a business goal, and verifying the retrieval of search results and leads through the frontend UI.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Create deployment configuration for the backend:

    *   Create `/infra/aws/beanstalk.yaml` (or similar configuration) to deploy the Node.js Express app, ensuring environment variables for API keys (Brave Search, OpenAI, SendGrid/Mailgun, Twilio) are securely stored. **(Tech Stack: Deployment, PRD: Section 6)

2.  Configure deployment for the frontend:

    *   Generate a production build of the React app and prepare to serve from an AWS S3 bucket (e.g., bucket named `app-static-assets` in `us-east-1`) with a connected CloudFront distribution. **(PRD: Section 6, Tech Stack: Frontend)

3.  Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that deploys changes from the `main` branch automatically to the chosen cloud environment. **(Developer Best Practices, PRD: Section 7)

4.  **Validation**: Run full end-to-end tests using Cypress against the deployed URL to validate user sign-up, business goal submission, and lead retrieval.

## Phase 6: Post-Launch

1.  Implement monitoring for backend API endpoints:

    *   Set up AWS CloudWatch alarms (or similar) to monitor API latency and error rates. **(Tech Stack: Monitoring, PRD: Section 7)

2.  Configure logging and backups:

    *   Enable daily database backups from Supabase using native backup tools or a cron job with `pg_dump`, and store backups in an S3 bucket. **(PRD: Section 7.3, Tech Stack: Database)

3.  Integrate analytics in the frontend dashboard to capture metrics such as email open rates, click-throughs, and conversion statistics. **(PRD: Section 4, Q&A: Analytics and Reporting)

4.  **Validation**: Simulate user load testing (using a tool like Locust or k6) to ensure the system scales and monitor performance metrics.

By following this detailed step-by-step plan, developers can execute an unambiguous implementation of the AI-Powered Lead Generation and Outreach Platform while meeting all core requirements and integrating the necessary third-party services.
